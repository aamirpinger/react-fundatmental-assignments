# Assignment 4 - Managing State
### Instructions

You're given a starter template with dummy data.

**Task**: Create a game that shows an equation of the form X+Y+Z=P. Here,
X, Y, and Z should be random numbers, and P should be the proposed answer. The
user should be able to answer wether it is true that the sum of X, Y, and Z
equals the proposed answer P. The user gets a point for each question the user
answers correctly. The score is displayed in this format: [number of correct
answers]/[number of questions answered]. Every time the user answers a question,
a new question that uses randomly generated numbers is displayed.

Remember that a Component's constructor is the first thing that runs when the
object is created. The render method gets called automatically every time the state changes
inside of the component and anytime the value of the component's props changes.

This exercise will help you practice what you've learned in the course so far, including the trickiest part of React - managing state.
