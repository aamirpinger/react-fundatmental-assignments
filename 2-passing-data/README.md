# Assignment 2 - Passing Data

# Instructions

Let's do something a little bit more complicated. Instead of displaying a
list of users and their movies, this time you need to display a list of movies.

For each movie in the list, there are two options:

1. If the movie has been favorited, then display a list of all of the users who said that this movie was their favorite.
2. If the movie has *not* been favorited, display some text stating that no one favorited the movie.

As you go about tackling this project, try to make the app *modular* by breaking it into resusable React components.

## Example

```html
<h2>Forrest Gump</h2>
<p>Liked By:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Nicholas Lain</li>
</ul>

<h2>Get Out</h2>
<p>Liked By:</p>
<ul>
  <li>John Doe</li>
  <li>Autumn Green</li>
</ul>

<h2>Autumn Green</h2>
<p>None of the current users liked this movie</p>
```
